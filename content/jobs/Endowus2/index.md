- Learning unfamiliar technologies like Dart and Flutter through independent research and working with a mentor.
- Implemented withdrawal suspension UI with Feature Flag as part of Endowous's compliance requirements with the purpose to block unverified users from withdrawing their cash balance.
- Proposed and currently exploring the use of Feature Flag as a solution to Backwards Compatibility to reduce the need to force update userâ€™s applications.
- Showcased an internal tool [that I developed] to the Engineering unit, which is currently pushed into production.
